# Fading

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thepont/fading.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thepont/fading)

Simple application for controlling LED's similar to christmas lights for Arduino.

New modes can be added by extending the `LightRunner` class, then adding the new mode to the LightRunnersArray in fading.ino.
